# Bitcoin Ticker ðŸ¤‘

## My Goal

The objective of this project was to learn about using Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform.

## What I created

I made a crypto currency price checking app to monitor my bitcoin investments on the move!

## What you have learned

- How to use the DropdownButton Widget from Material design.
- How to loop through code using Dart for and for-in loops.
- How to use Cupertino Widgets in your app.
- How to check the platform your app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.
- Revise previous concepts by completing the challenges.

## What to do next

- Customize the UI of this app to make it more attractive
- Currently, anytime the user picks a currency, the app sends a request to the API. However, the API won't response if too many requests are sent in such a short period of time. Therefore, I am planning on implementing some "tick" buttons for all crypto cards on the screen. A request is only made when the user click on each of those buttons.
- Make this app multi-screen
- Add more functionalities including "Add coin" and "Remove coin."
